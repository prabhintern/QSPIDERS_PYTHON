String formatting allows us to create dynamic strings by combining variables and values.
String formatting is the process of editing strings or adding different iterations to strings.
String formatting types - (with placeholders), (.format()), (with string literals).

-> With placeholders - %(to inject in strings.
-> EXAMPLE - S = "My name is %s and I am %d years old" % ('Karthik', 15)

a = "My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format('karthik', 20)
print(a)

a = "My name is %s and I am %d years old" % ('Karthik', 15)
print(a)

FORMATTING WITH .format()
a = "My name is {} and I'm {} years old".format('Karthik', 20)
print(a)

Controlling the flow of program execution is called flow control statements.
Flow control statements are classified into 2 types: 1) conditional flow control statement, 2) loop control flow statement.

Conditional flow control statement:
1) simple if
2) if else
3) elif
4) nested if-elSE         """
